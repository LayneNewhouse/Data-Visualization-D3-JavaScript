Data Visualization with D3.js and Dimple.js

Summary - 
This data visualization shows the average number of homeruns and batting average for a set of 1157 players.
By clicking the buttons on the top left of the screen the view can group the data by the respective facet.
This visualization demonstrates that, on average, left handed hitters and overweight, according to BMI, hitters hit more home runs and have higher batting averages than their counter-parts.
The exception to this is the switch hitters who have the highest average batting average but very low home run averages.

Design - 
I decided to use grouped averages because I felt that scatter plot of all of the individual player was both distracting and provided little insight.
After getting feedback from friend 'A' I grouped the variables height and weight together as BMI as this would give a better understanding of the player's body type.
I also decided to keep the original average on the graph so it could be used as a comparison (From Friend 'B').
Initially I was going to toggle that stats on the Y-axis but friend 'C' advised me to put the other stat on the x-axis and use colors to distinguish facets. 

Feedback - 
- maintain original averages
- use BMI instead of weight and height
- proper labels on the axes
- use the x and y axis for stats as opposed to using the x axis for categories
